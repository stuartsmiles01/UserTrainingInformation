From start of MP3 downloadable programme to 6.5 mins in
 - Description of Voucher Fraud attacks
 - Explanation of what and how the attack was conducted 
 - What behaviours the atttacker used to socially engineer the victim
 

Variations on the theme:
- type of item purchased: Google Vouchers, Amazon Vouchers, Apple iTunes Vouchers
Purchase from a shop and then give codes via phone or email to "your boss" 
- boss is using personal email address/phone as in a meeting
- switching contact to be to personal rather than work email (harder to track), phone/text message, 
- relies on inability to verify with real boss/person that they are actually for them
- pretext "boss is in [meeting/conference/travelling] but really needs this thing doing urgently
- compensating control - contact the person directly via known means [messaging system/phone/purchasing department would do this]
- compensating control - strong purchasing control [we do not buy & claim via expenses]
- victim targeting factors - social media [ I've just joined company x, welcome to the team, got a new job postings ] 
- social media information gathering [ OSINT to make pretext and names of people accurate as new employee is unaware the company procedures & context]
